‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for unauthorized access or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access.  Note: The core tool focuses on BTC and ETH. Community contributions may be needed to unlock full Solana support.

## How It Works

WalletGen is designed to generate wallets. It supports key algorithms for popular chains.

The software compares generated addresses against address databases or checks balances in real-time via blockchain explorers.

Wallet Gen is built in C++ and is open-source, allowing customization. Compared to Python-based wallet generators, Wallet Gen boasts significantly higher speeds, utilizing your CPU & GPU.

##  Why WalletGen?

Though designed for Bitcoin and Ethereum, the core of **WalletGen** can be expanded. Its speed and efficiency make it a strong foundation for potential Solana wallet exploration and experimentation. Written in C++ and optimized for multi-threaded CPU and GPU usage, WalletGen provides excellent performance for those seeking a fast, open-source solution.

## Features

-   **Cryptocurrency Wallet Creation:** Provides tools to generate various crypto wallets.
-   **Brute Force Search:** Searches for wallets with balances using brute-force methods, which *could* be adapted for Solana (with modifications).
-   **Algorithm Support:** Uses key algorithms.
-   **Database Integration:** Supports database integration for search acceleration.
-   **High-Speed Operation:** Designed to take full advantage of your CPU and GPU.
-   **Bitcoin Wallet Recovery:** The program allows recovering Bitcoin wallets by seed phrase.

## Supported Blockchains

-   Bitcoin (BTC)
-   Ethereum (ETH)
-   Binance Smart Chain (BNB)
-   Any EVM-compatible chain

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** allows you to search for crypto wallets with a balance.

### For Bitcoin (BTC) wallets:

*   Select option 3 in the menu or run start_search_btc.bat to search Bitcoin wallets via the internet. This uses real-time balance checks.

*   Choose option 6 to search Bitcoin wallets using the database. This is a faster method.

### For EVM wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Choose option 5 or run start_search_evm.bat to search EVM wallets over the internet.

*   Choose option 6 to search EVM wallets using the database.

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

When the program finds a wallet with a balance:
*   The search will stop immediately.
*   The wallet details will be displayed.
*   The data will be saved.

### How to Access the Funds?
1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the found wallet into any compatible crypto wallet.
2.  Transfer funds to your wallet.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen offers tools for recovering Bitcoin wallets via seed phrase.

### Process Description

#### Search for missing words:

If your seed phrase is missing words, use * as a placeholder.

#### Entering a complete seed-phrase:

Enter the full 12-word seed to check balances.

### Important recommendations

*   Seed-phrase must contain exactly 12 words.
*   Use only the * symbol for missing words.
*   Searching for missing words may take time.
*   Successful recovery stops the program and saves data.

## My Finds

![mywallet](/resources/chart.webp)

I‚Äôve recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first had 0.000032 BTC, the second contained 0.0528 BTC (roughly $4800 at the time of discovery).
Here‚Äôs the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay).
